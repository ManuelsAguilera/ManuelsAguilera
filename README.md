## Education

Im a 19 years old CS student, right now im cursing second year in [PUCV](https://www.pucv.cl/) college. 

I have been programming since i was little, but mostly was just following tutorials in Yt to make mods of Undertale, or to make commands in minecraft.

I've made some *Interesting* projects in scratch, and some mildly complex games in there with paralax included. (With only a little help of the internet) I'd add the scratch profile but is just very cringe.




## Languages

About actual languages I can speak mostly fluent english and spanish (I speak spanish natively). 

About programing languages... 
I know C, however im a little bit rusty with it, currently im working using java.

I use python a lot in CS courses, because it is really easy and fast to use, and to most of
my projects i really just want to get the results i want, and not necesarily need efficient results.


I was learning js, because i wanted to do a project on react, but i left that on hold. Mostly because i forgot.

## I really like linux!
### Here you can see my desktop enviroment on ubuntu.

### Im not good making rice, but i think it has some aesthetic to it :/

This is the Desktop Enviroment that i have installed on my laptop, wich i use to develop, and do college related stuff. I'd switch fully to ubuntu or another distro, problem is that i like playing valorant so I'm still using windows 10 on my main pc.


I'm thinking to change my OS to arch (btw)
But since im feeling really confortable in ubuntu with cinnamon, i dont think that would be such a great of an idea.
