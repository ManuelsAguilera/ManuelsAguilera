## Education

Im a 20 years old CS student, right now im cursing second year in [PUCV](https://www.pucv.cl/) college. 

I have been programming since i was little, but mostly was just following tutorials in Yt to make mods of Undertale, or to make commands in minecraft.




## Languages

About actual languages I can speak mostly fluent english and spanish (I speak spanish natively). 

About programing languages... 
I know C, however im a little bit rusty with it, currently im working using java, and C# since im learning to use Godot. 

I use python a lot in CS courses, because it is really easy and fast to use, and to most of
my projects i really just want to get the results i want, and not necesarily need efficient results.


I was learning js, because i wanted to do a project on react, but i left that on hold. Mostly because i forgot.And tbh i think javascript developers are oversaturated and dont think the language is fun either.

## I really like linux!
### Here you can see my old desktop enviroment on ubuntu.

### Now im using fedora because i like to distro hop, however i havent customized it a lot, so im using default gnome. 

This is the Desktop Enviroment that i had installed on my laptop, wich i use to develop, and do college related stuff. I'd switch fully to ubuntu or another distro, problem is that i like playing valorant so I'm still using windows 10 on my main pc.
