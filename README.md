## Education

Im a 20 years old CS student, right now im cursing second year in [PUCV](https://www.pucv.cl/) college. 

I have been programming since i was little, but mostly was just following tutorials in Yt to make mods of Undertale, or to make commands in minecraft.




## Languages

About actual languages I can speak mostly fluent english and spanish (I speak spanish natively). 

About programing languages... 
I know C, however im a little bit rusty with it, currently im working using java, and C# since im learning to use Godot. 

I use python a lot in CS courses, because it is really easy and fast to use, and to most of
my projects i really just want to get the results i want, and not necesarily need efficient results.


I was learning js, because i wanted to do a project on react, but i left that on hold. Mostly because i forgot.And tbh i think javascript developers are oversaturated and dont think the language is fun either.

## I really like linux!
### Here you can see my old desktop enviroment on ubuntu.

### Now im using fedora because i like to distro hop, however i havent customized it a lot, so im using default gnome. 

This is the Desktop Enviroment that i had installed on my laptop, wich i use to develop, and do college related stuff. I'd switch fully to ubuntu or another distro, problem is that i like playing valorant so I'm still using windows 10 on my main pc.

## Projects

I've finished a prototype to a project i had wanted to do for a long time.
It is a game where i simulate gravity physics in a 2d plane, it has lots of bugs but it helps as a sort of proof of concept. The game is developed in godot with c# for better performance, and it is in [this repository.](https://github.com/ManuelsAguilera/spaceGame)
The concept is mainly about wanting to have a videogame that feels like space, in the sense that you can die quickly, and your movement is butchered by the planets gravity fields. 
It is not how i really wanted it to be, and while its fun to regulate gravity constant, quantity of planets, etc. To see how it affects the player, it isnt a good simulator. 
Maybe i could implement smartest ways to simulate gravity physics such as:

-Using kmeans, to create clusters of the planets so its easy to calculate and control the player.

- Using a 3d enviroment instead of 2d, that way i can use shaders and with a camera and isometric sprites make the game have the same aesthetics I envisioned.

- Making better physics in general, maybe built my own physics engine or use another that isnt the main in godot.

## Things i want to do
- I want to participate in a game jam.
- Work at some place related to programing.
- Study a lot.

- I'd like to learn C# .NET because i have been using c# and i find it to be very confortable. 


## Things im doing

Taking lots of interesting Uni courses, such as: Computer Networks, Statistics and finance. 


Also im debating myself if i should build a physics engine for godot in order to simulate gravity or not. 
Probably wont do neither...
