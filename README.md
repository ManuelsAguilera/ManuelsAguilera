## Education

Im a 19 years old CS student, right now im cursing second year in [PUCV](https://www.pucv.cl/)


## Languages

About actual languages I can speak mostly fluent english and spanish (I speak spanish natively). 

About programing languages... 
Right now i dont have so advanced knowledge in lots of languages, but im really getting strong with C.
I've tried doing diferent projects in raw html and css, i havent uploaded them tho because most of them are pretty lame :p


I of course know some basic bash and work pretty well with the terminal, that is because..

## I really like linux!
### Here you can see my desktop enviroment on ubuntu.

### Im not good making rice, but i think it has some aesthetic to it :/



I'm thinking to change my OS to arch (btw)

But im feeling really confortable in ubuntu with cinnamon, so i dont think that would be so great of an idea.

## Things i want to do

- Learning C++ : Im feeling a little tired of C, and im hoping to change to c++ in the near future. Since i really want to start making programs wich work with a gui, and the attemps i've made doing that with c had been kind of rough.

- Making some dumb programing language: I dont really know a lot about compilers, but have this project in mind that basically would be, making a compiler in c that reads a file and translates it to c, and then compiles it with c. There is probably easier ways to do this without translating to c, but im interested because that idea sounds kinda funny.
