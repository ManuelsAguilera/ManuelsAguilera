## Education

Im a 20 years old CS student, right now im cursing second year in [PUCV](https://www.pucv.cl/) college. 

I have been programming since i was little, but mostly was just following tutorials in Yt to make mods of Undertale, or to make commands in minecraft.




## Languages

About actual languages I can speak mostly fluent english and spanish (I speak spanish natively). 

About programing languages... 
I know C, however im a little bit rusty with it, currently im working using java, and C# since im learning to use Godot. 

I use python a lot in CS courses, because it is really easy and fast to use, and to most of
my projects i really just want to get the results i want, and not necesarily need efficient results.


I was learning js, because i wanted to do a project on react, but i left that on hold. Mostly because i forgot.And tbh i think javascript developers are oversaturated and dont think the language is fun either.

## I really like linux!
### Here you can see my old desktop enviroment on ubuntu.

### Now im using fedora because i like to distro hop, however i havent customized it a lot, so im using default gnome. 

This is the Desktop Enviroment that i had installed on my laptop, wich i use to develop, and do college related stuff. I'd switch fully to ubuntu or another distro, problem is that i like playing valorant so I'm still using windows 10 on my main pc.

## Things i want to do
- I want to learn to make games, a little more specific would be:
- I wana make a chess ai, and im thinking to then convert it into something silly like chess rpg
- I wanna make a 2d space game, with realistic gravity simulation. I would say this is something that im working the most, and i hope to finish this project or at least a version, to the end of the year.

- I'd like to learn C# .NET because i have been using c# and i find it to be very confortable. 


## Things im doing

Taking lots of interesting Uni courses, such as: Os and hardware, AI, Databases. 


Also im debating myself if i should build a physics engine for godot in order to simulate gravity or not.
